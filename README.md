# SpaceInvadersRemake

### Overview
Made for second half of the Summer 2023 Practical Game Dev course at Texas State University.

Created as a back-up and alternative final project when the first project was failing to run properly.

### Possible Updates
- Add screen wrapping to sides of screen, to prevent the player from going infinitely left or right off screen and not having to play the game

### Update on Progress as of 9/12/2023
- Project is considered "done" as future progress is currently working towards a 2D fighting game.
